# Special Rulette Hoster
My own implementation of slightly different roulette in Java.
(this is just for you to use along you keeping track of bets. This program only shows the "imaginary roll" on the roulette.
<hr>

## How to use:
1. Open the directory where the Main.java is located, (I suggest making new directory for it)
2. `java Main.java` to run this.
3. It will show intro, press enter to continue.
4. You now see that something happened, press enter again to make first roll.
5. If you keep pressing enter, it will roll the ball. The _bet x2_ is there to tell you that if the player bet on red that you should give him x2 payout.
6. To exit, you can type **q**.


## Changelog:

**V1.0.0** (_Alpha_) = Main and first version.
